# A project-organisation kernel — Brainstorm record

**Status: this repository's founding record.** It is not a specification and not a plan. Its decisions
(K1–K18) are settled and constrain everything built here; its open questions (OQ1–OQ8) are this project's
first work. It was written in the EventML repository, during the session that decided ProjectML should
exist, and is carried over unchanged apart from this header.

**Reading the paths.** Unqualified paths — `spec/`, `examples/`, `decisions.yaml` — refer to the
[EventML repository](https://github.com/szantob/EventML), where the material discussed here currently
lives. Nothing in this document describes a file in ProjectML.

**Scope: a repository of its own, carried to its own 1.0 before `eventml-core` resumes.** Revised twice
during the session. The constraint stated at the outset was "after `eventml-core` 1.0"; it was withdrawn, on
the reading that EventML's own roadmap is about to spend five releases building kernel material inside
EventML, and then replaced by K14 — serialised work rather than an MVP running alongside. K15 settles what
that 1.0 is: the metamodel, described in text and diagrams, with no notation and no filled-in definitions.
OQ7 settles how a metamodel that exercises nothing on its own is verified; its answer proved circular with
K14's freeze, and **§7 resolves that by ordering the work into four phases**. Version numbers are ceremony at
this stage — see the note opening §4 — and §7 says where the 1.0 label lands once they are not. Nothing here
changes `spec/` as it stands.

**Date:** 2026-08-26
**Written in:** the EventML repository, branch `eventml-core-v0.5`, where a copy remains

## 1. The idea

Lift L0 and L1 out of EventML as a language of their own: a kernel that builds a requirement system out of
what people actually said, and that a design language then attaches to. EventML becomes one such design
language. SysML v2 and UML become others, on the same terms.

The argument for the cut is already in the specification, written for a different purpose.
`spec/06-sysml-mapping.md` §4 lists four things in EventML that do not survive translation to SysML v2 —
the value states, the question derivation, the L2 product-name rule, and the recording criterion. **Three of
the four live at L0/L1.** The language being lifted out is therefore not a competitor to SysML: it is the
front end SysML declines to have, and it ends exactly where SysML begins.

**It also stands on its own**, without any design language beneath it — a project can run the §2 loop and
stop at a baseline, having attached nothing. That is worth stating, and worth stating precisely, because the
obvious phrase for it overclaims. General-purpose project management means schedule, tasks, dependencies,
resources, budget and milestones, and the kernel has none of them and is not going to. What it covers is the
**evidence-and-decision half**: what was said, by whom, what it obliges, what is still open, what was
decided and why, and what changed since. Those are standard project-management artefacts — a decision log,
an issue log, a requirements register — with traceability holding them together, which is what the usual
versions lack. Claiming that half is a strong claim. Claiming the other half by implication is how a
specification acquires a first question it cannot answer, and it bears on OQ5.

## 2. The procedure the kernel serves

Given in the session as the reason the kernel exists. The goal is a *final* requirement system, and the
procedure is how one is reached.

1. A written source arrives — email, note, meeting transcript, a designer's own decision note — and is
   registered.
2. The source is analysed, and needs are extracted from the parts that carry information.
3. Each need is processed: its subject selects the requirement type, and the rules on that type's
   `RequirementDef` turn the stater's free words into the requirement's bound professional wording.
4. Creating requirements triggers a review of the model, which surfaces contradictions with earlier
   requirements, further questions needed for refinement, and other findings.
5. A model above the requirement model records the contradictions, gaps and pending decisions. It is
   analysed, a report is written, and somebody acts on it — a meeting is called, the client is telephoned,
   or the team decides for itself. **The outcome always enters the system as a new source**, whose needs
   produce requirements that resolve what was open.
6. The new requirements let the old contradicting ones be deprecated — never deleted, which would break
   traceability — and the imprecise ones refined.

The cycle ends when the model above empties: every question answered by somebody. The requirement model
then projects to a final, clean one by dropping the model above and the deprecated requirements.

**Three of these steps are already checkable in the language as it stands.** Step 2 by the source-coverage
report in `spec/04-uncertainty.md` §6, step 3 by question rule 8 from one side and rule 9 from the other,
step 4's questions by rules 1 and 2. Steps 3b, 4a and 5 have nothing.

> **Step 2's checkability does not carry across, per K40 and K41.** The source-coverage report named above is
> EventML's, and ProjectML defines no equivalent: whether every need was extracted from a source, and whether
> each one says what the passage behind it said, is the modeller's responsibility rather than the model's,
> found by self-review or cross-review after the modelling is done. What the metamodel checks over extraction
> is the other side only — a need that no requirement refines (K38). D33 is not overturned; it is sound where
> it was taken and simply not carried across. See ProjectML's `spec/06-decisions.md` and
> [`eventml-decisions.md`](eventml-decisions.md).

## 3. Decisions

| # | Decision | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| K1 | The kernel is L0/L1 — the evidence and intent chain. `Source`, `Need`, `Requirement`, `Decision`, the value-state model, the traceability relations and the checks over them. `Part`, `Port`, `Connection`, `Flow`, the definition entities below `Requirement`, `allocate`, boundary rules 2 and 3 and the AV libraries stay in EventML | `06-sysml-mapping.md` §4: three of the four things that do not map to SysML live at L0/L1. The cut follows a seam the specification already found |
| K2 | The kernel attaches symmetrically. It must sit under SysML v2, under UML, under EventML and under a design language not yet written, on the same terms in every case | Stated as the requirement the whole idea exists to meet. No design language gets a privileged path |
| K3 | The kernel sees below L1 through exactly one seam: an element outside the kernel carrying `satisfies`, naming a requirement | `06-sysml-mapping.md` §2 records `satisfy` as mapping directly to SysML v2 *including which end carries it*. The adapter the seam needs is already written. It keeps rules 3 and 6 computable over any design language |
| K4 | A design language attaches through a **binding** that declares four things: which of its elements may carry `satisfies`; its own internal refinement chain; its identifier space; and how far it takes the kernel's value model | The identifier problem is recorded in `06-sysml-mapping.md` §3 — `audio.part.stage_box` and `Audio::DigitalStageBox` are different identifier spaces, and a round trip without a map loses the stable IDs everything depends on |
| K5 | A `Requirement` carries a property marking it no longer in force. A requirement is never deleted | Traceability. Also the v0.5 WIP §5 argument for retirement: the checks are pairwise, so deleting an element silences exactly the check that fired on it |
| K6 | A `Need` carries no lifecycle state | A need belongs to its source, and a source is material of record — quoted whole, never edited. A quotation cannot cease to be true. What a need needs instead is a disposition; see OQ3 |
| K7 | Contradiction between requirements is found by human or AI review, not by rule. The kernel defines what a contradiction is, what a reviewer must cite, and how a found one is recorded — it does not detect them | Consistent with locked decision 1. A rule-based detector would find only the contradictions somebody anticipated by writing a constraint, which is the case that least needs finding |
| K8 | A requirement's type arrives with the `RequirementDef` chosen for it. Needs are not classified | D53 already has each template naming its kind. The need's subject selects the template; the kind rides along. This is why the v0.5 §5 origin clusters and a subject-driven procedure never collide — two axes, one contact point |
| K9 | Question rule 9 is a failed check, not a question | The rule's own text calls it an invariant: *"One invariant defines it: every requirement names its origin."* The rule tree already routes the parallel case — an L3 part with no `allocate` — to *"a failed check — boundary rule 3, not a question"*, and boundary rule 3's justification applies verbatim. See §6 |
| K10 | The model above the requirement model is a model, not a derived view | A contradiction links at least two requirements and must keep its identity between reviews. A recomputed report has no identity across runs; a modelled element does |
| K11 | **The requirement model changes only through sources.** Every outcome of a review — a meeting, a telephone call, the team's own decision — enters as a source | What makes traceability total rather than merely well-intentioned. It is also what makes K10 tractable: no finding can go stale unnoticed, because nothing moves beneath it without a source accounting for the move |
| K12 | The cycle ends in a **baseline**: a dated, identified cut of the requirements in force. A design language binds to a *named* baseline, not to "the requirements" | ISO/IEC/IEEE 29148's term, adopted under house rule 8 rather than coined. Without it the implementing team designs against a set that moves under them, which is the experience that makes engineers distrust requirement models. The cost is an identifier and a date |
| K13 | The baseline is a simplification for a different audience, not a model that must pass the kernel's checks. Its condition is losslessness and recoverability: everything in force is present, nothing in force was dropped, and everything dropped stays in the working model | The baseline drops the need layer, so need-coverage rules cannot apply to it — running them on it is a category error. People building the thing do not need to know what the candidate requirements were |
| K14 | **The work is serialised, not parallel.** The kernel gets its own repository, built from what exists today and carried to its own 1.0 with `eventml-core` frozen for the duration. EventML resumes afterwards, as the kernel's first consumer | The five releases on EventML's own roadmap are kernel work, so serialising does that work once instead of twice. It also dissolves the moving-target risk by decree rather than by mitigation: nothing can fork underneath a specification that is not moving. And a specification resumed against a finished kernel is a far better test of K2 than two that co-evolve and quietly accommodate each other |
| K15 | **The metamodel and its implementations are separate things.** The metamodel is the kernel proper — the L0/L1 types, the edges, the states, the rules, the binding contract — described in text and diagrams only. It defines what a `RequirementDef` *is*; **it contains no filled-in `RequirementDef`, and the moment any element goes into one, that is implementation.** Notation, the requirement types themselves and a base rule-set a project may vary as it runs all belong to an implementation: a self-contained package that can be adopted and carried forward on its own. **The metamodel is what reaches 1.0** | The abstract-syntax / concrete-syntax split, and what makes K2 reachable rather than merely stated. A design language attaching underneath brings its own notation, so any notation inside the metamodel would be imposed on it. EventML did not have to face this — `spec/05-concrete-syntax.md` sits inside `eventml-core` today because EventML has one audience. The kernel has many, so it cuts one notch higher |
| K16 | **An implementation is itself a metamodel**, for the project models built with it | Three levels, not two: the metamodel says what a `RequirementDef` is; an implementation is the filled set of them, and that set is what a project model is checked against. `examples/lib/` already plays this middle role in EventML — `audio.req.speech_intelligibility` is a filled `RequirementDef`, and `eventml-lib` versions separately from `eventml-core` for exactly this reason. The layering is not new; ProjectML only moves the notation from the first level to the second |
| K17 | **A binding lives with whoever owns the language it binds; where nobody does, it lives in the kernel.** The SysML v2 binding is written on paper and kept in the ProjectML repository, as the kernel's own reference and proof. EventML's practical implementation — notation, filled definitions, rule-set — lives in the EventML repository | The v0.3 ownership rule one level up: a vocabulary belongs to whoever owns it. Nobody outside ProjectML would maintain a SysML binding, so it is ProjectML's artefact; EventML's implementation has an owner and a library already, so it stays there. It also keeps the kernel repository tight — a metamodel and one reference binding, nothing else |
| K18 | **A binding is not an implementation.** The SysML artefact is a binding: K4's four declarations and nothing more. EventML's is an implementation, and it contains a binding | Keeping the words apart keeps the done-test sharp. An implementation carries notation, filled definitions and a rule-set; the SysML paper artefact carries none of the three, and calling it one would let OQ7's test be declared passed by a document that exercises nothing |

## 4. Open questions

**A calibration that applies to all of them.** Version numbers are ceremony at this stage: one developer,
no users, nothing to coordinate. Several recommendations below were argued partly from release discipline
and should be read with that discounted. It affects K14 least — **its content is the ordering and the
freeze, not the number.** Finish the kernel before resuming EventML is a real constraint whether or not the
finishing point is called 1.0. It affects OQ1 most: conformance levels are a coordination mechanism for
parties who do not exist yet, and the case for them is not the levels but the information they carry — what
an exported model loses — which could be written as prose today and formalised only when somebody else
needs it.

**OQ1 — One specification or two?** The kernel has two separable pieces: the evidence chain, which attaches
at exactly one seam, and the value-state model, which attaches to every value or to none. They cannot be
adopted equally — EventML's YAML lets a scalar be replaced by an object and SysML v2's textual notation does
not, so a SysML binding can take the first and not the second. Three options were put: one specification
with conformance levels (level 1 evidence chain, level 2 plus value states, level 3 plus question
derivation), two specifications, or one monolith. **Conformance levels were recommended and the question was
not answered.** The recommendation rests on the level itself becoming information: read a binding, and you
know what an exported model loses. That knowledge sits in prose today, in `06-sysml-mapping.md` §4.

**OQ2 — Does `RequirementDef` split?** It carries two kinds of attribute. `applies_when`, `params`,
`default` and `asks` are procedural, and their meaning bottoms out in the kernel's own value model.
`constraints` and `verification` bottom out in the design language's semantics — and `06-sysml-mapping.md`
§1 already maps `verification` to a SysML `verification def`, "which EventML v0.1 keeps as prose". **A split
along that test was recommended and the question was not answered.**

**OQ3 — The orphan need.** *Recorded as a problem to solve, at the user's request.*

> **Dissolved by K37–K39, not answered.** Its premise did not hold. The second of the two readings below —
> that a need may mean nothing at all — is a misanalysis: a statement about where the work happens or when a
> place is available is a constraint on the environment the system must work within, and it bears a
> requirement. What is genuinely open in such a case is not whether the need is a need but what follows from
> it, which is a dilemma, and K10 already gives a dilemma a home. So no disposition is needed, and the
> question this section asks has no answer because it should not have been asked. **K6's pointer to a
> disposition, above, is superseded on the same grounds.** See `spec/06-decisions.md`.

A need that no requirement refines fires question rule 8, and the rule has two readings. The specification
already knows both. `examples/03-festival-stage/brief.yaml` says so in `n-park`'s own notes — "the park is
where the event is, not something the system must achieve — one of the two readings a person has to choose
between when the rule fires" — and `examples/01-garden-party/brief.yaml` says of `n-lunch` that it "may
constrain the load-in or mean nothing at all, and only the venue can say which."

**What is missing is any way to record which reading won.** Seven needs across the three examples are
refined by nothing:

| Example | Needs refined by nothing |
|---|---|
| `01-garden-party` | `n-load-in`, `n-lunch` |
| `02-conference-room` | `n-same-as-last-year`, `n-room`, `n-house-lights`, `n-venue-tech` |
| `03-festival-stage` | `n-park` |

Every review re-adjudicates all seven, and the person doing it cannot see that somebody already did. The
conference room stages the sharpest case deliberately: `n-house-lights` is refined by nothing and fires rule
8, while `r-house-lights` names no origin and fires rule 9 — the same subject, both ends open, and no edge
between them.

This is not retirement, and K6 is why: the need was stated and remains stated. It is a **disposition** — a
record that the need was examined and deliberately produced nothing, with the reason. It has the same shape
as the second half of the v0.5 §3 open question: every declared kind either has a requirement in the project
or a written reason why it has none.

**The hazard to design against.** A disposition that costs nothing to write becomes a way to silence rule 8,
which is precisely the failure the v0.5 WIP identifies for deletion — *"deletion becomes a way to make a
report clean, with nothing recording that a choice was made."* Whatever form a disposition takes has to make
the silencing visible: a reason at minimum, and probably a source or a decision standing behind it.

**OQ4 — Does the kernel name the loop's steps normatively?** Asked twice and answered around both times. The
options were: entities only; entities plus the five steps as a normative process, adopting ISO/IEC/IEEE
29148's process vocabulary; or entities plus lifecycle states with no process prescribed. **The third was
recommended**, on the ground that the process is the part most likely to collide with an adopting
organisation's own way of working, and therefore the least portable thing the kernel could make normative.
K5, K6 and K10 all point that way without settling it.

**OQ5 — What is the kernel called?** **ProjectML** was put forward, with a question mark. It reads well and
it is the obvious parallel to EventML. One reservation is worth recording before a repository fixes it:
*project* claims the whole of project management — schedule, budget, resources, people — while the language
does requirements engineering and nothing else. A name that overclaims invites the wrong first question from
everybody who reads it, and a repository name is cheap to change this week and expensive in a year.

**OQ6 — What is the MVP, and where does it live?** The session opened under an "after 1.0" constraint and
withdrew it: the extraction should be an MVP project of its own, probably in a separate repository.

**The argument for not waiting.** Read the v0.5 WIP §4 release order — a library declares its requirement
kinds, then project-management logic, then what produces a decision, then how the model survives change,
then the question lifecycle. **Not one of those five is AV-specific.** `eventml-core` is about to spend five
releases building kernel material inside EventML. Waiting for 1.0 does not avoid the work; it does the work
in the wrong repository and moves it afterwards.

**The argument for caution.** The kernel's own content is the part of EventML moving fastest. `Source` and
`Need` became entities in v0.4, and the five releases above all land on the same material. An extraction now
forks a moving target, and the MVP has to be designed against that rather than around it.

**What "viable" means for a specification.** There is no software to ship, so the MVP is minimum *provable*
rather than minimum runnable, and CLAUDE.md §5 already fixes the standard: a concept that appears in no
example is unproven. The decisive test is therefore not that the kernel has the entities — moving files
proves nothing — but that **a second, non-AV domain walks end to end without the kernel changing**, and that
**two bindings can be written**, one to EventML and one to SysML v2. K2 is either true or false, and one
non-AV binding decides it.

**What failure would look like**, stated in advance so the MVP can fail honestly:

- the SysML binding cannot be written without changing the kernel's entities — K2 is false
- the non-AV example needs a concept L0/L1 does not have — the cut is in the wrong place
- the domain leaks in §5 turn out to number thirty rather than three

Three MVP shapes were put — a thin snapshot, a thick one absorbing v0.5, and one with no repository at all —
and a fourth was chosen instead: **build the repository and carry it to its own 1.0 before resuming
EventML.** That is K14, and it is not an MVP. What remains open is what its 1.0 contains.

**Three things the decision leaves unsettled.**

*What "what exists today" means.* v0.5's requirement-kinds work is brainstormed and **not implemented** —
the branch carries two records and no specification change. So the starting point is `v0.4.0` plus two
brainstorm records, which is a clean line, but only until somebody implements something. It should be named
as a tag rather than as a date.

*What happens to v0.5.* Its subject — a library declares the kinds of requirement it handles — is kernel
material entire. **The recommendation is that it moves to the kernel rather than being deferred**, and that
`eventml-core` v0.5 as currently conceived does not happen at all. Deferring it would leave a designed
release pointing at material that no longer lives in the repository.

*What 1.0 means.* **Answered by K15: 1.0 is the metamodel.** The question that replaces it is not what 1.0
contains but how it can be verified — see OQ7.

**One constraint to fix now, because schedule pressure will take it first.** A 1.0 whose only worked
examples are events has not proved neutrality; it is EventML's L0/L1 under a new name. **A non-AV worked
example, and a SysML binding, are release criteria and not extras.** The gate recommended earlier survives
K14 in a weaker but still useful form: write the SysML binding *early* in the kernel's life rather than as a
precondition for the repository, so that a false K2 is discovered in week two instead of at 1.0.

The question that follows 1.0, and is not settled: how EventML then relates to the kernel — a citation with
the kernel authoritative, or a copy. K14 makes the first much more likely, since a frozen EventML resuming
against a finished kernel has no reason to keep a copy.

**OQ7 — What is the metamodel's done-test?** K15 puts the notation in an implementation, and that collides
with the only verification this family of specifications has. CLAUDE.md §5 says a concept appearing in no
example is unproven, and the v0.4 plan applies the same test to refuse a construct outright: *"An
unexercised construct is an unproven one, so it waits."* Examples are written in a notation. **A metamodel
with no notation exercises nothing on its own.**

K16 says where the exercise has to come from instead: an implementation is the middle level, so the chain is
metamodel ← implementation ← project model, and the metamodel is reached last. What is being chosen is how
far down that chain the metamodel's own done-test reaches.

- **One implementation runs the loop.** The metamodel is done when one implementation exists and carries the
  §2 procedure end to end on one project, terminating in a baseline. Proves the metamodel is implementable.
- **One implementation, plus the SysML binding on paper.** The same, and one binding document — K4's four
  declarations — written against SysML v2 without a second library behind it.
- **Two implementations in two domains.** An event one and a software one, both running the loop. The only
  version that fully tests neutrality, and roughly twice the work before anything is finished.

**Answered: the second**, with the placement settled by K17. One implementation proves the metamodel can be
built on; it does not prove the metamodel is neutral, and neutrality is the entire thesis. Two
implementations prove it and double the work first. The second option tests neutrality **where neutrality
actually lives** — at the seam, which K3 and K4 say is one field and four declarations — for the cost of one
document, and it is the earliest point at which a false K2 becomes visible.

**OQ8 — The done-test and the freeze are circular as they stand.** Answering OQ7 with the second option
produces a conflict with K14 that neither decision shows on its own:

- K14 freezes `eventml-core` until the kernel is finished.
- OQ7 says the kernel is finished when an implementation runs the loop end to end.
- K17 puts that implementation in the EventML repository.

So the kernel is finished when EventML does something, and EventML is frozen until the kernel is finished.
Three ways out:

- **Read the freeze narrowly.** What K14 freezes is EventML *growing its own specification* — the five
  roadmap releases of kernel material. Building EventML's ProjectML implementation is a different activity,
  and it is the resumption K14 already anticipates. The two phases then **overlap by exactly one step**:
  the last thing the kernel needs is the first thing EventML does on resuming.
- **Host the practical implementation in the kernel repository temporarily** and migrate it to EventML
  afterwards. Keeps the phases strictly serial, at the cost of contradicting K17 for the duration.
- **Weaken the done-test** to the paper binding alone, which is OQ7's first option with the exercise
  removed — and then nothing runs the loop before the kernel is declared finished.

**Answered by the four phases in §7**, which resolve the circularity by ordering the work rather than by
qualifying the freeze. One adjustment goes with them, recorded there: the phases are a work order, so the
1.0 label belongs at the end of the fourth rather than the first, or the metamodel is declared finished
before the thing that exercises it exists — which is the third option above, the one to refuse.

**A consequence of the implementation half, worth recording before it is designed.** K15 puts "a base
rule-set a project may vary as it runs" in the implementation. If the rules can change mid-project, then a
check result is only meaningful against the rule-set that produced it, and **a baseline (K12) has to name
the implementation package and version it was cut under** — otherwise a baseline validated last month cannot
be told apart from one validated under different rules. The date and identifier K12 asks for are not enough
on their own.

## 5. Findings worth keeping

**The value-state model is not confined to L0/L1.** `spec/04-uncertainty.md` §1 says wrapping applies to
"any value anywhere in a model — a brief field, a `Requirement.params` entry, a `Part.properties` entry, a
`Connection` length". This is what forces the two-piece structure behind OQ1: the evidence chain attaches at
one seam, and the value model attaches everywhere or nowhere.

**Three domain leaks sit in an otherwise neutral L0/L1**, and would have to become library-declared
vocabularies rather than fixed enumerations:

- `Source.kind`: `email | call | document | site_visit | rider | regulation` — **rider** is event-specific
- `Source.from` and `Decision.by.party`: `client | venue | production | authority | performer` — **venue**
  and **performer** are event-specific
- the catalogue identifier's domain enumeration, fixed by locked decision 3

**D55 has a stronger reason than the one recorded.** The v0.5 WIP justifies leaving the taxonomy to the
library by ownership (the v0.3 rule) and by house rule 8 (coin nothing). Both hold. The stronger reason is
structural: **a taxonomy fixed by the language would fix a single classification axis**, and the WIP's own
§5 finding is that SysML classifies by the nature of a requirement while this domain's logic splits by
origin. A fixed taxonomy would exclude every design language classifying on another axis — which is to say,
it would make the kernel unattachable. D55 is not a courtesy to library owners; it is what makes K2
possible.

**Findings come in three kinds, and they behave differently.** A failed check and a question are both
decidable by script and are recomputed on every run, so storing them only risks staleness. A review finding
needs judgement to produce and is lost unless it is stored. K10 settles the storage question; the
distinction still matters, because only the third kind can carry a state.

**`Source.answers` is the natural closing edge for a finding.** It already runs from a source to the earlier
sources it responds to. Extending it to close a finding makes closure evidence rather than a tick somebody
applied — the same move `agreed_by` already makes for consent.

**`Source.from` correlates with the v0.5 origin clusters but is not a function.** Client to Programme, venue
and site visit to Site, authority and regulation to Regulatory, our own judgement to Consequential — four
origins, four clusters, and the correspondence is not a coincidence, because "who could answer" is what the
clusters split on. It is not a dispatch, though: a client can state a site fact. Under K8 nothing turns on
it, and it survives at most as a smell test — a kind that disagrees with its source's origin is worth a
second look. Whether that is signal or noise could be measured against the 22 templates.

## 6. What this touches in released work

**Question rule 9 shipped in `v0.4.0`.** K9 is therefore a change to released specification, and it is
available independently of everything else here — it needs no kernel and no 1.0. Two further pieces of
evidence beyond the rule's own wording: its worked example carries `blocks: 0`, so it never competes for
attention the way a question does; and `spec/04-uncertainty.md` §4 already calls it "the exception among the
rules added in v0.4", which is a specification being uncomfortable with its own categorisation.

**One consequence has to be accepted with it.** `spec/04-uncertainty.md` says "Rule 9 is rule 6 one layer
up, and the symmetry is exact." If rule 9 moves and rule 6 does not, the symmetry stops being exact and that
sentence needs correcting. Rule 6 should not move with it: no invariant says every L2 part satisfies
something, and an infrastructure block that satisfies nothing is a fair question rather than an error.

## 7. The order of work

Four phases, settled in the session, resolving OQ8 by ordering the work rather than by qualifying the
freeze:

1. **Bring the ProjectML metamodel to a complete draft.** Types, edges, states, rules, the binding contract.
   Text and diagrams; no notation, no filled definitions.
2. **The SysML implementation** — the paper binding of K18, kept in the ProjectML repository under K17. This
   is where a false K2 shows up, and it is early on purpose.
3. **Take the ProjectML elements out of EventML.** Spec surgery: the L0/L1 sections of `spec/01-layers.md`,
   the four kernel entities in `spec/02-metamodel.md`, `spec/04-uncertainty.md`, the kernel relations in
   `spec/03-relationships.md`, and `decisions.yaml`.
4. **Build EventML’s ProjectML implementation**, in the EventML repository under K17.

**Where the 1.0 label goes.** The phases are a work order, and 1.0 is a claim about verification, so the two
do not coincide. Under OQ7 the metamodel is finished when an implementation has run the loop and the SysML
binding exists — the end of phase 4, not the end of phase 1. Read phase 1 as *complete draft* and the four
phases hold together; read it as *released* and the metamodel is declared finished two phases before
anything exercises it.

**Phases 3 and 4 are one piece of work, not two.** Between them EventML has no L0/L1 and nothing to replace
it, so every example fails the rule that verifies it. Survivable inside a branch, not survivable across a
tag: nothing should be released from EventML between them.

**Phase 4 is smaller than its name.** EventML already holds most of an implementation —
`spec/05-concrete-syntax.md` is the notation, and `examples/lib/*/requirements.yaml` is 22 filled
`RequirementDef`s. Much of phase 4 is declaring what exists as a ProjectML implementation. The genuinely new
work is what the kernel adds that EventML never had: the kind list, the need disposition of OQ3, the model
above, and the baseline.

**What still has to be answered, and when.** OQ2 blocks phase 1 directly — phase 1 defines what a
`RequirementDef` is, which is exactly what OQ2 asks. OQ3 and OQ4 are phase 1 as well. OQ1 belongs to phase
2, where a binding first has to state what it cannot take; K15 reshapes it, since the value states are
portable where progressive wrapping is notation and is not. What remains of OQ6 is settled enough by K15 and
K16 to act on — the slot is metamodel, the list is implementation. OQ5 waits for the rest on purpose.

§6 sits outside all four phases. Rule 9 is already released and its recategorisation needs no kernel.
